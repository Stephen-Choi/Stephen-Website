				Hello there! As you can probably tell by now, my name Stephen. As for a bit about myself, in short I am an aspiring computer scientist. It is funny because every year I seem to change professions. I began my high school life wanting to become an engineer, then to a marketer, then to an accountant, and now I think I have settled on a career as a developer. In my opinion, I would like to think that I like to learn as opposed to being indecisive haha. My thoughts on life are that you can never learn enough and that anything and everything that you learn could save you at some point down the road! So moral is learn, learn and learn your way to success!

			<p class="bio-text">In my free time I like to sleep (somewhere between 12-24 hrs), eat (sweets yum) and play (sports and anime). Additionally, in my spare time I like to volunteer in the community. I believe in giving back in whichever way possible, that's why I've joined a couple of great organizations (Creativity Through Arts and Project 5K) that serve to better the GTA! </p>

		<p class="project-text">My first project ever was a site for a youth council called Creativity Through Arts. The site was made using HTML, CSS and JQuery. The project proved to be quite a challenging feat at the time since I just started learning how to code but I learnt a lot while making the site so it was all worth it.

It was a good project to help improve my skills in the java language. I am now currently working on a second game which I hope will be done soon!</p>
